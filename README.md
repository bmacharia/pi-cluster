## 🧭 Overview

This repository showcases a **production-ready Kubernetes platform** engineered using **GitOps principles**, **infrastructure as code**, and **enterprise security standards**. It is architected to demonstrate how modern organizations deploy, manage, and scale cloud-native infrastructure using **K3s**, **FluxCD**, **Kustomize**, and a complete observability stack.

> This platform is designed as a **real-world production reference** — capable of supporting internal developer platforms, microservices, and mission-critical workloads using **declarative, secure, and self-healing automation**.

## 🎯 Key Platform Capabilities

| Capability                    | Description                                         | Outcome                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **GitOps Automation**         | Continuous reconciliation using FluxCD              | Zero-drift, auditable deployments        |
| **Security by Design**        | SOPS encryption, RBAC, TLS, network policies        | Production-grade protection              |
| **Observability Stack**       | Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager                   | Full visibility into workloads & cluster |
| **Infrastructure as Code**    | Kustomize + Terraform for cluster and app lifecycle | Repeatable and scalable architecture     |
| **Self-Healing Operations**   | Automatic rollback & reconciliation on failure      | 24/7 platform reliability                |
| **Multi-Environment Support** | Staging and Production via declarative overlays     | Safe promotion workflows                 |

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

* **GitOps-controlled secrets** encrypted using SOPS + Age
* **Zero Trust principles** via NetworkPolicies and TLS
* **RBAC enforcement** across namespaces
* **Non-root containers** and immutable infrastructure
* **Automated dependency updates** using Renovate

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

| Component         | Purpose                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Prometheus**    | Metrics & alerting data source |
| **Grafana**       | Visualization and dashboards   |
| **AlertManager**  | Automated notifications        |
| **Node Exporter** | System-level performance data  |

Key dashboards include:

* Cluster health and performance
* Workload metrics
* Storage and network activity
* Alerting & incident response-ready views

---

## ⚙️ GitOps Workflow

```text
1. Developer pushes change to Git
2. FluxCD automatically detects change
3. Flux applies change to cluster
4. Prometheus/Grafana validate cluster state
5. Rollback occurs automatically if reconciliation fails
```
